Directions to execute the code:
1) Run 'generatedataset-trainval-full-weak-500.lua' and 'generatedataset-test-full-weak-500.lua' to generate training and testing data in t7 format.
2) Run 'post-train.lua' on a system with capable GPU and memory to train the CNN model.
3) Run 'run-on-test-set.lua' to create maxpooledscores (output) by testing the trained model on test data (in t7 format).
4) Run 'confusionmatrix.lua' to generate the accuracies of all classes calculated from the confusion matrices obtained for each class.

Index of brief description of each script:
1) confusionmatrix.lua - generates the confusion matrix for each class and calculate the accuracies too.
2) featureextractor.lua - extracts the features from an image and store it into t7 format
3) generatedataset-test-full-weak-500.lua - converts test image set into batches of t7 format
4) generatedataset-trainval-full-weak-500.lua - converts training image set into batches of t7 format
5) post-train.lua - trains the CNN
6) run-on-test-set.lua - create maxpooledscores (output) by testing the trained model on test data (in t7 format)
